## Description

Cloudy meadows is an urban vertical farming community. Meet interesting people, farm with composting and helpful animals, and if you get 
far enough buy robots to do the work for you. When the big mean investment banker forces a buyout of the land the farms are on, the community 
is only given 100 days to gain 10,000 coins.



## A little bit about the work
Cloudy Meadows is a project we have worked on for the majority of the summer, and started as a small jam game. 
Cloudy Meadows was not a school project or meant for our school in any shape or form. This is one of the first complete games we have made in awhile, we worked on 
adding lots of content and flushing out every system in the game, such as watering plants, getting and completing quests from npc, entities that move and can 
interact with the world, and how robots are programmed to work for you. We even came up with a way to use local stoarge to save all of your world and player data.

We worked with:

- JavaScript p5.js 
- HTML 
- CSS 
- Local Storage
